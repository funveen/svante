# Svante

*Named after the Svante Arrhenius, one of the first who estimated the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on the surface temperature of our Earth*

A reimplementation of the project [CO<sub>2</sub>narienvogel](https://github.com/netzbasteln/co2narienvogel) in MicroPython for ESP8266 boards (e.g. D1 Mini). It measures the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in a room to warn about high levels at certain thresholds. High CO<sub>2</sub> levels correlate with aerosols exhaled by humans and are an indicator for an increased Covid-19 infection risk.

The original project is based on [coro2sens](https://github.com/kmetz/coro2sens) and [ideas from Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld](https://www.umwelt-campus.de/forschung/projekte/iot-werkstatt/ideen-zur-corona-krise), which are based on 2008 [research by the German Federal Environmental Agency](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/pdfs/kohlendioxid_2008.pdf).
